\label{chap2}
\thispagestyle{empty}

\noindent In this section i'll show the low-level architecture of the sPFWFDMid module. 
With this chapter you'll able to update the middleware in the future. 
Because I have completely changed most of the code in this module, you should consider completely deprecated the version of SPF1 and inside the documentation.
